## Catching pokemon
The context: As a Pokemon hunter, there are only three Pokemon left to complete the collection. Using the data with knowledge on various features like geographical coordinates, time, population density, etc from [Predict'em All dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/semioniy/predictemall), and machine learning algorithm to train a classifier that, based on a location's latitude and longitude, can tell us which Pokemon is more likely to appear there.

## Cats and Dogs classification
Using the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) which comprises of 25k colour images of dogs and cats, the main objective with this dataset is to create a classifier that can classify if the input image is a cat or a dog.

## Nationality prediction
The main objective is to create an RNN module using PyTorch, and train it to predict the nationality of a given input name. The RNN will process each character of an input name at a time, and at the last character output a probability mass function over the possible countries.
